Add the super-hyped Path menu interface to your Appcelerator Titanium apps. Check out [path.com](http://path.com) for the inspiration.

### Highlights

* [12 second demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJrXuNkvkZc)
* Supported on iOS and Android
* Tested against Titanium Mobile 1.8.0.1 CI and 1.8 RC

### Additional Notes

* A minor hack to the core Titanium Mobile SDK is necessary to get icon rotations working correctly with iOS. I will be including that patch in the very near future. The reason I'm not submitting it as a pull request to [titanium_mobile](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile) is because it is very function-specific and would create a parity issue between ios and android.
